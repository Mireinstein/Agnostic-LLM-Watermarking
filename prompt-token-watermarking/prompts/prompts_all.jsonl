The goal of the training process is to learn a function that maps inputs to their corresponding correct outputs. This learned function can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen examples.In unsupervised learning, the model is not provided with labeled training examples. Instead, the goal is to discover the underlying structure of the data through techniques such as clustering. One common example of unsupervised learning is dimensionality reduction, where the goal is to identify the most important features that capture the structure of the data.In summary, supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, while unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data."}
